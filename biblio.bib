 abstract = {An analysis of data on the duration times and waiting times for eruptions from the Old Faithful Geyser reveals an interesting time series structure. A tentative physical model, derived from Rinehart, is outlined and a corresponding first-order Markov chain examined. It is shown that a second-order models is necessary to explain the observed correlations in the data. A curious clustering effect is apparent in the autocorrelation function when plotted over a large range of lags. Similar patterns are observed in simulations from the fitted second-order model.},
